She's taken a job as a tour guide, but she hates it and it shows: the tourists, mostly American, are bored with history and facts; they want to shop. Every group has a goofy couple, a frat boy, a sullen teen, a feuding couple, divorc√®es looking for a mate, and a funny guy. This group is no exception, plus there's no air conditioning and a bearded silent driver. Thanks to an unlikely friendship, plus daisies, an ice-cream cone, the history of syrup, and the Oracle at Delphi, Georgia may have a shot at finding her kefi during this four-day tour.","genres":["Comedy","Romance"],"id":65,"imdb":{"id":865559,"rating":5.9,"votes":13624},"languages":["English","Greek"],"lastupdated":"2015-09-05 00:45:49.713000000","metacritic":34,"num_mflix_comments":0,"plot":"A travel guide rediscovers her romantic side on a trip around Greece.","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE3MzQ2NzczNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgyNDgzMg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","rated":"PG-13","released":{"$date":"2009-06-05T00:00:00Z"},"runtime":95,"title":"My Life in Ruins","tomatoes":{"boxOffice":"$8.5M","consensus":"With stereotypical characters and a shopworn plot, My Life in Ruins is a charmless romantic comedy.","critic":{"meter":9,"numReviews":121,"rating":3.6},"dvd":{"$date":"2009-10-06T00:00:00Z"},"fresh":11,"lastUpdated":{"$date":"2015-08-25T18:25:11Z"},"production":"Fox Searchlight Pictures","rotten":110,"viewer":{"meter":44,"numReviews":280066,"rating":2.6},"website":"http://www.foxsearchlight.com/mylifeinruins/"},"type":"movie","writers":["Mike Reiss"],"year":2009}]
