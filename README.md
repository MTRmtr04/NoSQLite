# NoSQLite

NoSQLite is a lightweight, local, and schema-less NoSQL database system designed to store and manage unstructured data using JSON files.
It offers a simple and flexible alternative to traditional relational databases and heavier NoSQL engines, requiring no server or external dependencies.

## Purpose

The main goal of NoSQLite is to provide an intuitive, easy-to-use document database system for:
    - Small-scale or personal applications
    - Educational tools and academic projects
    - Prototyping systems that work with unstructured or variable data

By mimicking core NoSQL concepts such as flexible schemas and document-based storage, NoSQLite enables developers to quickly build and test projects without worrying about strict tables and structures or complex setup processes.

## Features

    - JSON-based storage
    - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - Unique file paths generated from document hashes
    - Collections that allow heterogeneous document structures
